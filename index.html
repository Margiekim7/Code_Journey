    <h1>Hello world! Margie here</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my coding journey, newbie here learning to code. I am super
      excited for the journey ahead of me and ready to tackle challenges coming
      my way, I look forward to creating something from scratch and being able
      to solve problems. Happy to talking to computers with a language they
      understand. I am a motorcycle lover and I enjoy riding bikes because the
      wind is therapeutic and the engine roaring is music to my ears. Naked
      bikes are my preference and I look forward to the day I get to own my
      motorcycle. Fun fact I am a newbie to this biking thing but well we all
      get better with time. hayaa twende kazi sasa!

    <h2>Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>
      A motorcycle is a two-wheeled motor vehicle that is steered by a handlebar
      and ridden on a saddle-style seat. Also commonly referred to as a
      "motorbike" or "bike," it's essentially a self-propelled version of a
      bicycle, with an engine providing the power.
