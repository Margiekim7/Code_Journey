      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"> motorcycle</a> is a
      two-wheeled motor vehicle that is steered by a handlebar and ridden on a
      saddle-style seat. Also commonly referred to as a "motorbike" or "bike,"
      it's essentially a self-propelled version of a bicycle, with an engine
      providing the power.

    <h2>History of Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>
      The history of motorcycles began in the late 19th century with the
      invention of the internal combustion engine. The first true motorcycle,
      the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_Reitwagen"
        >Daimler Reitwagen</a
      >, was patented in 1885 in Germany. Early motorcycles were essentially
      motorized bicycles, and the industry grew rapidly, particularly in the
      United States and Europe, with companies like Harley-Davidson and Indian
      emerging in the early 1900s. These bikes were crucial during the two World
      Wars for military use. After WWII, they became a symbol of freedom and
      rebellion. Throughout the 20th century, Japanese manufacturers like Honda,
      Yamaha, and Kawasaki revolutionized the industry with faster, more
      reliable, and mass-produced bikes, solidifying the motorcycle's place in
      global transportation and culture.
